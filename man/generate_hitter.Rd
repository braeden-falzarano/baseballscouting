\title{Generate Hitter Performance Report}
\usage{
generate_hitter(player_ids, start_date, end_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_ids}{A vector of numeric player IDs representing the hitters to analyze.}

\item{start_date}{A character string representing the start date of the data range in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{end_date}{A character string representing the end date of the data range in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the central strike zone heatmap with average exit velocity.
Additionally, tables summarizing general hitting statistics are displayed in the viewer.
}
\description{
This function fetches Statcast data for a given hitter or list of hitters, calculates key performance metrics,
and generates a strike zone heatmap displaying the average exit velocity in the central zone.
}
\details{
The function performs the following:
\itemize{
\item Fetches player names using the MLB Stats API.
\item Fetches Statcast data from Baseball Savant for the specified hitter(s) and date range.
\item Filters data to include only balls in play.
\item Calculates key metrics such as average exit velocity, launch angle, hard-hit rate, and strikeout rate.
\item Creates a strike zone heatmap focusing on the central strike zone.
}

The results include a heatmap visualizing average exit velocity in different strike zone regions and
a table summarizing key performance metrics.
}
\note{
This function requires an active internet connection to fetch data from the MLB Stats API and Baseball Savant.
